Business Problem

A bank is experiencing customer churn and needs to understand why customers are leaving. The objective is to analyze customer data to identify patterns and behaviors that differentiate customers who have churned from those who have not. The key questions addressed in this analysis are:

1- What attributes are more common among churned customers?

2- What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?

3- How does customer behavior differ across different geographic regions?
