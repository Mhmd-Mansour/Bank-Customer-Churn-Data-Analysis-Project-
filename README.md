Executive Summary

This project analyzes bank customer data to understand the key factors contributing to customer churn. By exploring customer demographics, account activity, and product usage, this analysis uncovers actionable insights that can help the bank develop targeted retention strategies, improve customer engagement, and reduce churn rates.

Business Problem

A bank is experiencing customer churn and needs to understand why customers are leaving. The objective is to analyze customer data to identify patterns and behaviors that differentiate customers who have churned from those who have not. The key questions addressed in this analysis are:

1- What attributes are more common among churned customers?

2- What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?

3- How does customer behavior differ across different geographic regions?

Results & Business Recommendations

The analysis was performed using Python, with a focus on data exploration, profiling, and trend analysis. Key findings and their corresponding business recommendations are as follows:

Active Status Is Key:

- Finding: Customers who are active members are significantly less likely to churn, indicating a strong correlation between engagement and customer retention.

Recommendation: Prioritize initiatives that increase customer engagement and promote active use of bank services.

Surprising Churn Factors:

- Finding: Customers with a higher number of products and larger account balances showed a higher tendency to churn.

Recommendation: Investigate the specific reasons why high-value customers with multiple products are leaving. This may point to issues with product bundling, service quality, or a lack of personalized incentives.

Geographic Insights:

- Finding: The analysis showed distinct differences in customer behavior across different regions.

Recommendation: Develop tailored marketing and retention strategies for each region to address unique customer needs and preferences.
